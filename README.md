# Project D
This will be our first game as a club! ProjectD will be the codename for this game for now as we try to find another name for it. It was initially called "Demon + Assassin Duo, Combat Focused 2D Sidescroller (Hope to also Implement Story + Dialogue)", but that was kinda long :)

## Initial Game Description
In this game you play as a gun-knife wielding assassin in a large city setting. Due to a set of unfortunate circumstances in the slums (being caught stealing an important artifact or before assassinating a target), the main character is killed and his body is thrown into a dumpster. You are resurrected by a shadowy demon who, along with giving you a second chance at life and lending you its power, encourages you to dive deeper into your past and learn more about the organization that you've never questioned before. You play along with your organization's missions for now while trying to discover more about yourself, your demonic companion, and the underlying scheme behind everything. 

Main mechanics:
 - 2D combat focused platforming
 - Ranged attack/quick melee combat, dash/dodge ability
 - Healing through taking down enemies; harder(tankier) enemies give more (heal?) points, focus to heal yourself 
 - Optional dialogue system where you can chat or hang out with your demon pal(they are your roommate now, they will not leave)
 - Checkpoints along the game (by checkpoints I mean beating bosses, discovering an important item instead of gradual progression) that give your demon "inspiration," allowing you to use their abilities in new ways (traps, thrown projectile that explodes into an AOE on impact) and level/exp system 
 - Level Progression style similar to Iconoclast: freely run around levels and collect optional resources before heading to the next levels, some levels Boss fights/chase sequences

Art Style:
 - Pixel art inspired by Katana Zero 
 - idk if this counts as art style but to tie some abilities to the story, visually your ranged attack is the gun and your melee is a shadowy swipe forwards (the demon takes the form of a bracelet on your wrist during missions, extending forwards into a blade). The ability to heal also comes from your demon.
